# 📊 Business Insights 360 – Power BI Project for AtliQ Hardware

End-to-end Power BI project for AtliQ Hardware — finance, sales, marketing, supply chain & executive insights.

🚀 Turning Guesswork into Data-Driven Growth

# AtliQ Hardware BI Project

AtliQ Hardware is one of the fastest-growing companies in the electronics market. But their growth journey was built on gut feelings and assumptions — like a failed expansion into Latin America.

That’s when they realized: data is not optional, it’s essential.

This project demonstrates how I, as a Data Analyst, built an end-to-end BI solution to transform AtliQ’s raw data into actionable insights across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive reporting.

## 🟡 Problem Statement

- AtliQ relied heavily on assumptions for business expansion.

- The Latin America expansion led to major losses due to a lack of data-backed decisions.

- Leadership needed a data-driven system to compete and grow sustainably.
